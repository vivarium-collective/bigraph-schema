Welcome to `bigraph-schema` – a library providing a serializable type schema for compositional systems biology 
simulations. This library is an integral component of the broader Process Bigraph project, which seeks to create an 
innovative framework for representing, simulating, and analyzing complex biological systems.

The goal of `bigraph-schema` is to support interoperability and extensibility across compositional modeling, 
facilitating seamless integration with existing and future modeling platforms. This is achieved by establishing a 
standardized and serializable schema for the complex, hierarchical, and multiscale nature of biological systems.
